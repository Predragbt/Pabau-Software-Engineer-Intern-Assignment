Rick and Morty Characters Explorer

This project is a web application built with React that uses the Rick and Morty API to display, filter, and sort characters from the popular TV series. It also supports multilingual functionality (English and German) using react-i18next.

Features
Character Listing:

Displays all Rick and Morty characters in a card layout with details like name, status, species, gender, and origin.
Cards are paginated with infinite scrolling.
Filtering Options:

Filter by Species: Choose from all available species of characters.
Filter by Status: Filter characters by "Alive", "Dead", or "Unknown" statuses.
Sorting Options:

Sort characters by Name or Origin in ascending order.
Multilingual Support:

Toggle between English and German using the language switcher in the footer.
All UI text and filter options are translated dynamically.
Dynamic API Queries:

The app fetches data dynamically from the Rick and Morty GraphQL API based on user-selected filters.
How It Works
Homepage
Displays characters as cards in a responsive grid layout.
Each card includes:
Name (localized if available).
Status (Alive, Dead, Unknown).
Species.
Gender.
Origin location.
A placeholder button for potential future actions.
Filters
The filter dropdowns allow users to filter characters by species and status:
Species: Populated dynamically from the API.
Status: Predefined options ("Alive", "Dead", "Unknown").
Filters are applied by querying the API with the selected filter values.
A "Sort By" dropdown allows sorting by name or origin.
Infinite Scrolling
As you scroll, additional pages of characters are fetched from the API and appended to the list.
This provides a seamless browsing experience without needing to click pagination buttons.
Language Switcher
Located in the footer, the language switcher allows users to switch between English and German.
Upon switching, all UI elements, including filter dropdowns, status values, and labels, are updated to reflect the selected language.

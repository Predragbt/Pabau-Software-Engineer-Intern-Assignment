Rick and Morty Characters Explorer

This project is a React-based web application that utilizes the Rick and Morty GraphQL API to display, filter, and sort characters from the series. It supports English and German languages through react-i18next.

Features:

*Character Listing
- Displays character details (Name, Status, Species, Gender, Origin) in a card layout.
- Infinite scrolling to load more characters seamlessly.

*Filtering & Sorting
- Filters: Filter by species (dynamic) and status ("Alive", "Dead", "Unknown").
- Sorting: Sort characters by Name or Origin in ascending order.

*Multilingual Support
- Supports English and German.
- All text, filters, and labels are dynamically translated.

*Dynamic Character Details
- View additional details of a character on a dedicated page, including type, location, origin, and dimension.
- Error handling for invalid character IDs with a dedicated "Character Not Found" page.

How It Works:

*Homepage
- Characters are fetched dynamically from the API and displayed in a responsive grid.
- Filters and sorting options are available above the character grid.

*Character Details
- Access detailed information about a specific character by clicking on their card.
- Handles invalid character IDs gracefully with an error page.

*Filters & Language Switcher
- Apply species and status filters, which dynamically fetch data from the API.
- The language switcher in the footer allows users to toggle between English and German.

- Characters.tsx: Main page for listing characters with filtering, sorting, and infinite scrolling.

*Error Pages:
- NotFound.tsx: For invalid routes.
